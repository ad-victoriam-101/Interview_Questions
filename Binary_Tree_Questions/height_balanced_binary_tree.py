#given a binary tree, determin whether or not its a height - balanced. 
#this can be defined as one in which the heights of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one.

#step one: make binary tree with N nodes.
#step two: count the number of nodes/branches on each side. 
#step three: if this number is the same return true.else return false.
